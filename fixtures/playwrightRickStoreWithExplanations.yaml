# *.yaml or *.yml is all about indentation (mostly 2 spaces)
name: Playwright Tests # pipeline's name
on: # when to run
  push: # run on every push
    branches: [main] # run on every push to main branch (or more branches)
jobs: # set of tasks that runs sequentially as defined by the user
  playwrighttests: # job's name

    steps: # hat is to be done (like npm install for instance)

          | # instead of "uses", we explicitely type "run" to use terminal commands independently of any github action; | pipe allows us to use mulitple commands below | "&"" next to app's name allows other commands to run (otherwise the Rick's App would run forever, preventing other commands to be executed) | echo prints out commands | "npm ci" installs dependencies from package-lock.json | test:ci is a script in package.json ("playwright test") and we use it to differentiate between CI test run and local test run (and it doesn't need to be --headed obviously)
